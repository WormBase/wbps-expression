description: 'MHco3 is the anthelmintic-susceptible reference isolate and MHco4 and MHco10 are anthelmintic-resistant isolates. The samples submitted are from 4th generation backcrosses and the progeny of each backcross generation was selected for resistance with ivermectin. RNA-seq analysis of each backcross will compare gene expression with the anthelmintic-susceptible and -resistant parent isolates with the aim of detecting differential gene expression associated with resistance.
