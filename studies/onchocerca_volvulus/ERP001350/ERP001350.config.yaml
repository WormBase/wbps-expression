description: 'Onchocerca volvulus is a filarial nematode parasite of humans, causing Onchocerciasis, or River Blindness, which affects over 37 million people, mainly in Africa. It is a severely debilitating disease, which is transmitted to humans by black fly. This project aims to undertake high-throughput sequencing of Onchocerca volvulus transcriptome for de novo assembly of transcripts. The main objective of this project is to recognize genes expressed in given life stages.'
