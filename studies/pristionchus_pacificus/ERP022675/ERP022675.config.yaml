description: 'In this study, we generated a cross between the P. pacificus reference strain (PS312) and an isolate from la Reuinion and geneotyped the resulting offspring after inbreeding of 10 generations by means of RNA-seq.This data can be used to map phenotypic differences between both parental strains, perform expression qtl analysis and to create a novel high-resolution genetic linkage map for P. pacificus.'
