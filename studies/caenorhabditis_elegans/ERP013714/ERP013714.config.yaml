description: 'Transcriptome profiling of Lir3 C.elegans mutants. Larval stage L4 worms were used for RNA isolation from N2 (Bristol), Q40 (polyglutamine model) genetic background; Lir3 and wiltype controls. Experiments were done in triplicates using ribosomal RNA depletion. Libraries were sequenced with 50bp reads on Illumina HiSeq2500 platform'
