description: 'To uncover the host response pathways that are modified by a B. subtilis diet and that may provide the protective effect against Î±-synuclein aggregation, we performed comparative global transcriptomics analysis using next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We compared young adult animals fed on three different diets, E. coli OP50 and B. subtilis PXN21 lawns, consisting of both spores and vegetative cells, and a mixture of both bacteria.'
