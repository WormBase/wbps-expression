description: 'CEPsh glia were isolated from C. elegans mix larvae population by FACS, based on expression of a GFP marker under control of the CEPsh glia-specific marker hlh-17. All other cells, which are not expressing GFP, were collected separately for control. RNA reads from GFP-positive and GFP-negative samples were compared to identify CEPsh glia-enriched genes.'
