description: 'AMsh glia were isolated from C. elegans L4 larvae by FACS, based on expression of a dsRed marker under control of the AMsh glia-specific marker F16F9.3. From control animals, dsRed-positive and dsRed-negative samples were compared to identify AMsh glia-enriched genes. To identify glial targets of the transcription factor pros-1/Prospero, dsRed-positive samples from control and pros-1(RNAi) animals were compared.'
