description: 'Performed RNA-seq analysis of animals with xbp-1s overexpression (ER stress response transcription factor) in specific neuron types: pan-neuronal, serotonergic neuron, dopaminergic neuron, and both serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons, all compared to a wild-type control. RNA-seq was performed on purified RNA extracted from ~1000 whole worms using a proprietary Genewiz protocol described briefly in the manuscript. 3 biological replicates are provided for each sample.'
