description: 'We aimed at identifying the transcriptomes of single and double mutants of the two C.elegans Mi2 homologues, let-418 and chd-3. Embryos depleted for one or both genes were manually sorted and synchronised at the 24- and 100-cell stages, and their transcriptome compared to control embryos in order to identify de-regulated target genes, and determine whether the two Mi2 proteins are functionally redundant.'
